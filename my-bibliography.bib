               genetic algorithm with unidirectional ring migrations to nVidia
               CUDA software model. The proposed mapping is tested using
               Rosenbrock's, Griewank's and Michalewicz's benchmark functions.
               The obtained results indicate that our approach leads to
               speedups up to seven thousand times higher compared to one CPU
               thread while maintaining a reasonable results quality. This
               clearly shows that GPUs have a potential for acceleration of GAs
               and allow to solve much complex tasks.",

  abstract  = "The island model for evolutionary algorithms allows to delay the
               global convergence of the evolution process and encourage
               diversity. However, solving large size and time-intensive
               combinatorial optimization problems with the island model
               requires a large amount of computational resources. GPU
               computing is recently revealed as a powerful way to harness
               these resources. In this paper, we focus on the parallel island
               model on GPU. We address its re-design, implementation, and
               associated issues related to the GPU execution context. The
               preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
               proposed approaches and their capabilities to fully exploit the
               GPU architecture.",
